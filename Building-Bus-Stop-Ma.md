# My Visualizations 🚀  

Welcome to my **My Visualizations** repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing some of the interactive and insightful visualizations I’ve worked on as part of my data analytics journey.

## 📍 **Project: Interactive Geospatial Map**  

This project was one of the most exciting parts of my work where I visualized **building-to-bus stop connections** for Kansas City. The goal? To analyze accessibility patterns and uncover insights for urban planning.  

### **Why this Map?**  
I wanted to bridge data analysis with real-world application. By plotting connections between buildings and their nearest bus stops, this visualization highlights gaps in accessibility that can help improve city planning.  

### **Tools and Libraries Used**  
- **Python’s Folium Library**: For building the interactive geospatial map.  
- **pandas**: To clean and prepare the datasets.  
- **scikit-learn**: To perform clustering analysis with K-Means.

## 🌍 **View the Map**  

Since the map file is quite large, I’ve hosted it on **Google Drive** for easy access:

## 🛠 **How to Use the Map**  

1. **Download the File**: Click the link above to download `Building_Bus_Stop_Map.html`.  
2. **Open in Your Browser**:  
   - Double-click the file, or  
   - Right-click and select **Open with... > Your Preferred Browser**.  

Once it’s open, you’ll be able to interact with the map, zoom in/out, and explore all the building-to-bus stop connections visually!

## 🔧 **How it Works**  

Here’s what I did step-by-step to bring this project to life:  
1. **Data Collection**: I worked with building data and bus stop data for Kansas City.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and merged the datasets using **pandas**, ensuring accuracy for latitude and longitude points.  
3. **Clustering**: Applied **K-Means clustering** to group buildings based on distances to their nearest bus stops.  
4. **Visualization**: Used **folium** to create an interactive map where you can see:  
   - Building types,  
   - Bus stop locations, and  
   - Lines connecting buildings to their nearest stops.

## 🚀 **Future Updates**  

This repository will be my go-to place for adding more visualizations and data projects in the future. I plan to explore new datasets, experiment with more advanced visualizations, and maybe even integrate machine learning techniques. Stay tuned!
